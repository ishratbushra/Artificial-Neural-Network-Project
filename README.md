# Artificial-Neural-Network-Project

This project is done by implementing artificial neural network algorithm and multiple layers to build a model using Python language. Here, activation functions Relu and sigmoid and optimizer SGD (Stochastic Gradient descent) are used. It predicts if a patient has diabetes or not.
